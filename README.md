## Udacity Data Engineer Nano Degree Project-1

## Data Modeling with Postgres

# 1.Overview

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. 

This database will provide Sparkify the ability to simply query the needed data. They will have the ability to introduce a better user experience by enhancing the song and music recommendation, in addition to the ability to develop existing user activity.

### 2.1 Fact and dimension tables for a star schema.


#### <font color='#8204B5'>Fact table:</font> 
Is the central table in a star schema of a data warehouse. A fact table stores quantitative information for analysis and is often denormalized.

#### <font color='#230430'>Dimension table: </font> 
They used to describe dimensions; they contain dimension keys, values and attributes.

### 2.2 Create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis.


Using `create_tables.py` file to drops and creates the required tables. We run this file to reset the tables before each time we run ETL scripts.

### 2.3 Create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

<code> etl.ipynb </code>  reads and processes a single file from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.

`etl.py` reads and processes files from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads them into the tables. We fill this out based on the work in the ETL notebook.

* data/song_data : Contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.
* data/log_data : Consists of log files generated by the streaming app based on the songs in the dataset above.

### 2.4 write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

`sql_queries.py` contains all the sql queries, and it is imported into the last three files above.

### 2.5 Test the database and ETL pipeline by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify.

Data can be verified using the provided `test.ipynb` jupyter notebook.
